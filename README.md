 ### Models Used in the Code:

1. **Naive Bayes Model:**
   - **Description:** Naive Bayes is a simple probabilistic classifier based on applying Bayes' theorem with strong independence assumptions between the features.
   - **Code Implementation:** In the code, Multinomial Naive Bayes is used for sentiment analysis. It is trained on the count vectorized data to classify sentiments as positive or negative based on the text input.

2. **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) Model:**
   - **Description:** RNN is a type of neural network designed to recognize patterns in sequences of data, such as text. It maintains a memory of the sequence processed so far and is useful for tasks like sentiment analysis where context matters.
   - **Code Implementation:** In the code, a SimpleRNN layer is used in the Keras Sequential model. It learns patterns in the text data to predict sentiment labels, with a spatial dropout layer to regularize and prevent overfitting.

3. **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Model:**
   - **Description:** LSTM is an improved version of RNN that overcomes the vanishing gradient problem. It is suitable for learning long-term dependencies in sequential data and is widely used in tasks like sentiment analysis and language modeling.
   - **Code Implementation:** The LSTM model in the code is built using Keras Sequential API. It processes the text data, captures long-term dependencies, and predicts sentiment labels with a high level of accuracy.

### Explanation of Each Model in the Context of the Code:

1. **Naive Bayes Model:**
   - **Usage:** Naive Bayes is selected for its simplicity and efficiency in text classification tasks like sentiment analysis, making it a good choice for this scenario.
   - **Application:** It processes the text data by converting it into count vectorized form and learns to differentiate between positive and negative sentiments based on these counts.

2. **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) Model:**
   - **Usage:** RNNs are employed when capturing sequential patterns is essential, as in sentiment analysis where context plays a significant role in determining sentiments.
   - **Application:** The SimpleRNN layer in the model processes text sequences, utilizing its memory to maintain context and predict sentiment labels based on the learned patterns in the text data.

3. **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Model:**
   - **Usage:** LSTMs excel in handling long sequences and are well-suited for tasks requiring memory of past information, making them ideal for sentiment analysis on text of varying lengths.
   - **Application:** The LSTM model in the code processes the text data, leveraging its ability to retain long-term dependencies for accurate sentiment classification, as demonstrated by its high accuracy compared to other models.

In summary, Naive Bayes is used for its simplicity, RNN for capturing sequential patterns, and LSTM for effectively modeling long-term dependencies in text data for sentiment analysis. Each model serves a specific purpose and contributes to the analysis pipeline with distinct advantages based on the nature of the task at hand.
